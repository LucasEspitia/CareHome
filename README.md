# CareHome 
CareHome App is a prototype application primarily built in Java and JavaFX, although its model and internal logic have been developed to be compatible with Android Studio.

In the project, you will find the creation of an architecture, as well as its main documentation in a PDF file, which clarifies the purpose and explains the application in more detail.

In summary, you will find in the repository an application created in Java, designed to be compatible with smart home use and aimed at the user's well-being.

It should be noted that the process of creating this app has been as follows. First, diagrams were created using Enterprise Architecture (EA), demonstrating knowledge of best practices in architecture creation and software modeling. Subsequently, the code has been implemented gradually according to the diagrams that required more specific input.

## Languages
